    <h2>Magic Amongst Us</h2>
	  <h3>Plot/Synopsis</h3>
      <p>Born with the gift of magic Joleen always felt like she did not belong. She felt alone in a world where magic only seems possible in books or on tv.<br> One day her life took an unexpected turn
	  when Clay appeared out of nowhere telling her she was not what she thoght was.<br>
	  Cray, right? But not as crazy as her adventures she got herself into when she agreed to listen to
	  his story and meet his brother. It all went downhill from there on. By the Gods she should have
	  just stayed at home.</p>

<div id="change-of-a-Lifetime">
	  <h2>Change of a Lifetime</h2>
	  <h3>Plot/Synopsis</h3>
	    <p>Raven had no idea that her life could get worse after walking into her
      fiance fucking his boss while she was bringing him a home cooked meal. But
    when she fled the scene and the country for a last minute vacation she would
  soon find out that her fiance was the last of her troubles. Now she had to
pretend to be someone else in a land she never knew existed. And to make matters
worse the Queen just got married to a handsome tall druid named Deagan. Their
union should bring back the magic to the land of Vale from the crazy shadow king
and his army of unseelie fae. She had no idea that the danger she is in might
involve loosing her life... and her heart</p>
</div>
<div id="reapers">
	  <h2>Reapers</h2>
	  <h3>Plot/Synopsis</h3>
	    <p>Born with the mark given by a Reaper she never knew she had a destiny
      outside her own Realm until Mordecai showed up. He brought her to the In
    Between to be part of the I.B.R.D. (In Between Reaper Department) and
  maintain the balance between good and evil and keep the restless souls in check.
It sucked living there where your neighbours are the ones you killed off. The
looks alone will make you feel unwelcome. But the worst part of her new job as a
Reaper wasn't the 'keeping her neighbours in check' part, it was actually
collecting the souls of the innocent. But the ferryman waits for no one right?</p>
