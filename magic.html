  <h2>Synopsis</h2>
    <p>Born with the gift of magic Joleen always felt like she did
      not belong. She felt alone in a world where magic only seems
      possible in books or on tv. <br> One day her life took an
      unexpected turn when Clay appeared out of nowhere telling
      her she was not what she thoght was.<br> Crazy, right? But
      not as crazy as the adventures she got herself into when she
      agreed to listen to his story and meet his brother.<br> It
      all went downhill from there on. By the Gods she should
      have  just stayed at home.</p>

      <P class="popup-text">"Before we start I want to ask you something.
        Do you want to steal my magic?"<br>
      "And I have to tell you honestly I have no idea what I am up against
      nor do I have any experience with healing someone, well other than a
      little bird who broke its wing." Joleen said. <br>
      "So how is the bird doing?"<br>
      "I healed its wing... but it kind of exploded after that. You have to
      understand it was my first attempt at healing someone and I pushed
      too much of my magic on it. I've been having troubles controlling
      my magic latley."<br>
      "Yeah, well I am not in a rush to die so if you don't mind I would
      rather take my chances with normal medicine and hope for help
      from my Queen."</p>

		<a class="close" href="#">&times;</a>
	  <div class="content">
      <P class="popup-text">"And you call yourself a man, little
        cry baby, its just a scratch"<br>
        Both Oberon and Clay had to laugh when she said that. <br>
        "She is right little brother, you can hardly see it."<br>
        "That is because I heal quickly. My arm was hanging on a
        few pieces of skin just moments ago, you guys just missed it."<br>
        That made Joleen and Oberon laugh so hard they had tears
        running down their faces. <br>
        "You do remember the time we had the discussion about being
        a man right? You were making fun of the way I ate my melon
        and calling me less of a man for it..."<br>
        Joleen stopped her laughing and leaned in to listen to this
        story because she had a feeling it would be a good one. <br>
        Clay Smiled. "Yes I do and I still stand by claim. A man
        that doesn't like his face getting wet while eating a melon
        off the peel is not a man at all. How can you even satisfy a
        woman if you can't even do that?"<br>
        "Well at least I have a woman to satisfy no matter how I
        eat my melon, you with your cry baby ways will never even get
        to that stage in the first place."<br>
        Clay smacked Oberon on his arm after his last remark and
        Oberon reacted by digging his finger into Clay's wound.
        That is when  they started to fight in a way only brothers
        can. Joleen has seen them do this a few times before and now
        just let them be, still smiling about the conversation these
        two just had. Melons, really...</p>

      <P class="popup-text">"Wow that is kind of high. How quickly do
        your bones heal?" Joleen walked up to him and glanced
        outside the window. <br>
        "My bones don't heal that fast and to be honest I don't
        think there will be enough of me left to heal in the first
        place if I would jump from this height. What are we running
        from anyways?" Clay was still looking outside of the window
        to find the right place to let Joleen land without basically
        killing her. He heard her question as she asked it a second
        time. "We are running from my brother, well part of my
        brother."</p>

      <h3 class="popup-text">Can you tell us a little bit about
         yourself?</h3>

      <P class="popup-text">“My name is Joleen Abberdeen and I am 23 years old. I come
         from a little town called Radiant and use to live there with
        just my dad before he passed. I worked as a server in a bar and
         can do a bit more than the average mortal or Fae. What?
         Well that you have to read for yourself.”

      <h3 class="popup-text">What would be your dream Crew of actors to
        play your story in the movies?</h3>

      <P class="popup-text">“I would love to choose actors that
         are starting ones because we all know what a hard life it is
         as a beginning artist. For Oberon I would choose a man that
         looked like a Jason Momoa type. For Clay I would say Golem
         but he is not a real character unfortunately, so maybe we
         could find an Ogre that would be crazy enough to play him. The resemblance would be striking. But all jokes aside someone a bit younger than the Oberon actor but with a good set of muscles and humor. For Eladrin I would choose that actor from the serie ‘Black sails’ I think he is called zach mcGowan, yeah him or a look a like just like that. Rough but handsome. For Morgana she has to be played by the most gorgeous looking woman that has yet to be discovered. All natural beauty. For the rest I have no idea, Others will have to think about it.”</p>

      <h3 class="popup-text">Do you have a fun fact for us from
         the Magic amongst us story?</h3>

      <p class="popup-text">“Well funny thing is that I learned
         that a real man eats melon from the peel and not cut it up
         first. What that means well I can not tell you that without
         revealing something in the story, sorry guys!”</p>

      <h3 class="popup-text">What profession would you be if you
         could choose anything?</h3>

      <p class="popup-text">“A preschool teacher. To work every
        day with little kids and help them smile and get stronger
        must be amazing. You see their development every day and I am
        amazed at how much they  would grow both inside and out
        throughout the years. It must be amazing to be part of that
        growth”</p>

      <h3 class="popup-text">What was the biggest struggle
        throughout your story in this book?</h3>

      <p class="popup-text">“Pfff, you are not making this easy
        on us are you. I will try to answer without revealing to much.
        My biggest struggle was to accept who I was and have always
        been. That is still part of my struggle today but I learned
        that I, like everyone else, matter no matter who you are or
        what you love or what you can or can not do. It's a long
        process but I do believe I have already come far from the
        Joleen in the beginning of the story to the Joleen that sits
        here with you today.”</p>

      <h3 class="popup-text">My final question. For the people
        who can’t see you right now you are obviously pregnant.
        Congratulations first off and can I ask how far along you are
        and who the father is or is that also to revealing?</h3>

      <p class="popup-text">“Aww thank you, yeah it's pretty
        obvious isn’t it. I am due in 2 weeks if all goes to plan and
        the father is...Well you have to read about that in the book,
        I am sorry.”</p>

      <h3 class="popup-text">I want to thank you for this
        interview and would love to ask you more in the future if you
        do not mind. Maybe do a fan Q&A? Also keep us updated with
        the birth please.</h3>

      <p class="popup-text">“That would be pretty cool. Just
        ask and I will answer as soon as I can. And when the baby
        arrives I will be sure to send you guys a card.”</p>

		<div class="content">

		  <h3 class="popup-text">Can you tell us a little bit about
        yourself?</h3>

      <p class="popup-text">“My name is Clay and I am the
        youngest of my family. I grew up with my older brother Oberon
        and 3 sisters, so it was a full house so to say. Me and my
        brother where placed at court as Sidhe because we come from a
        royal line, even if its very much a deluded nowadays, and
        serve our Queen as her private guards.  I love hunting,
        mostly women and training with the other Sidhe. That’s about
        it I think.”</p>

        <h3 class="popup-text">What are readers going to think
          about after they turn the last page of this book?<h3>

        <p class="popup-text">“That one is easy, me of course!
          I can’t reveal to much but I think I will conquer some hearts
          in the end and leave a lasting impression.”</p>

        <h3 class="popup-text">So you are the most important
          thing in the whole story?</h3>

        <p class="popup-text">“Well no I wouldn’t put it like
          that. But without me the story would feel empty. But
          thinking about your question the readers might actually smile
          when they come to the end of this book and know not all is
          lost.</p>

        <h3 class="popup-text">Is there going to be a big plot
          twist or surprise in this book you play a part in?</h3>

        <p class="popup-text">“You are asking hard questions
          that I can not answer without revealing some details of the
          story. But I do know that the story was written in a way to
          keep you involved from the first part to the last page. Maybe
          even longer.”</p>

        <h3 class="popup-text">What sort of person is going to
          like the character Clay in this book?</h3>

        <p class="popup-text">“Well it is me not a character
          don’t forget, but to answer your question I think someone who
          likes jokes and doesn’t take everything too seriously is
          going to like me throughout the story. I love to joke around
          but that will make people love or hate you in the end.”</p>


        <h3 class="popup-text">Who do you look up to?</h3>

        <p class="popup-text">“My brother Oberon and Joleen too.
          And do not forget my Queen Morgana Le Fay. They are all
          mountains in my life that I can always climb up to and hold
          on to when a storm hits. I seriously wouldn’t know what to do
          if I didn’t have these people around me.” </p>

        <h3 class="popup-text">If you had a magic wand, what
          story would you love to be in?</h3>

        <p class="popup-text">“Fifty shades of course, but I
          would love to be that Christian guy with some more balls and
          a little more imagination. I mean why have a red room if you
          do not use it all the time with many, many women to please.”</p>

        <h3 class="popup-text">Last question, If this story was
          to be turned into a movie, who would you like to play as you?</h3>

        <p class="popup-text">Chai Hansen, the guy that played
          the monkey king. He can fight like me and looks like my
          twin brother so that would be an easy pick.</p>

        <h3 class="popup-text">I want to thank you for this
          interview and would love to ask you more in the future if you
          do not mind. Maybe do a fan Q&A?</h3>

        <p class="popup-text">“That would be awesome, count me in!”</p>
