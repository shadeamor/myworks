Today I saw a little boy<br>
That drowned as he fled a war<br>
He was one of the many victims<br>
That could never walk on this shore<br>
<br>
His crime was that he was born<br>
The wrong side of a land<br>
And that his parents fled a country<br>
And took him by the hand<br>
<br>
An ad says what should we do?<br>
As a country throw them out?<br>
Lock the doors and hide the keys?<br>
Let nature work it out?<br>
<br>
If I even have a voice<br>
My voice would be to say<br>
Who are you to decide<br>
Who can live here and who can stay<br>
<br>
The shores are filing, stacking up<br>
With bodies from the sea<br>
People who are scared and fleeing<br>
People just like you and me<br>
<br>
So look into your loved ones eyes<br>
And tell me honest and true<br>
Would you not ask for shelter somewhere<br>
If it was your loved one and if it was you?<br>
<br>
Would you not die inside<br>
If your baby ends up dead<br>
Drowned because of the great big sea<br>
How many tears would you have shed?<br>
<br>
I will remember this little boy<br>
That lost his daddyâ€™s hand<br>
Never to feel the freedom<br>
Or playing in the sand<br>
<br>
Little boy who should have had<br>
A long life up ahead<br>
He went towards the wrong safety<br>
And thus he ended up dead<br>
<br>
R.I.P.
