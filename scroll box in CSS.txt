How can we ensure that we can view all of an element that is larger than its parent's containing area? 
The overflow property controls what happens to content that spills, or overflows, outside its box. It can be set to one of the following values:
hidden - when set to this value, any content that overflows will be hidden from view. 
scroll - when set to this value, a scrollbar will be added to the element's box so that the rest of the content can be viewed by scrolling.
visible - when set to this value, the overflow content will be displayed outside of the containing element. Note, this is the default value.

p {
  overflow: scroll; 
}

In the example above, if any of the paragraph content overflows (perhaps a user resizes their browser window), a scrollbar will appear so that users can view the
rest of the content.
The overflow property is set on a parent element to instruct a web browser how to render child elements. For example, if a div’s overflow property is set to scroll, 
all children of this div will display overflowing content with a scroll bar.
