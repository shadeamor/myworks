how to center and image, kind of using the float command:

IMG.displayed {
    display: block;
    margin-left: auto;
    margin-right: auto 
}

when using float: left or float:right remeber the command clear:left or clear:right.

The clear command is used when items bump into eachother, and to determine which item should move.
