When writing CSS rules, it's possible to require an HTML element to have two or more 
CSS selectors at the same time.

This is done by combining multiple selectors, which we will refer to as chaining. 
For instance, if there was a .special class for h1 elements, the CSS would look like:

h1.special {

}
The code above would select only the h1 elements that have a class of special. 
If a p element also had a class of special, the rule in the example would not style the paragraph.

as such if you have in html

<h1 class=special>TESTING</h1>

<p1 class=special>TESTING 2</p>

and you write in your css

h1.special {
  color: red;
}

only h1 will be affected and not p1

will not work if the code is:

<div class="special">

<h1>TEST ONE</h1>
<h4>TEST TWO</h4>
<p>TEST THREE</p>

</div>

To then, do a selector h1.special to only target h1, h1 must have the class="special" for it to work

in order to affect only h1 in the explample above you have to code:

.special h1 {
  color: red;
}

this type of selection overrides the following code

<div class="special">

<h1 class="a">TEST ONE</h1>
<h4>TEST TWO</h4>
<p>TEST THREE</p>

</div>

h1.a {
  color:black;
}

so if you have in your css:

.special h1 {
  color: red;
}
       &

h1.a {
  color:black;
}

the text will come out red
